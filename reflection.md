Reflection: What I Learned About React This Week

This week, I learned how to move from static web pages to dynamic, interactive user interfaces using React.  
Building my To-Do App gave me hands-on experience with React fundamentals such as components, props, and state.

I learned how to use the `useState` hook to manage and update data dynamically and how the `useEffect` hook can save and load data from localStorage, allowing my app to remember tasks even after refreshing.  

I also improved my understanding of:
- Event handling for forms and buttons  
- Conditional rendering to display messages dynamically  
- Styling with TailwindCSS  
- Adding smooth animations using Framer Motion  

One challenge I faced was running and deploying React apps on my Android device, but I learned how to use StackBlitz and Netlify to get around those issues.  

Overall, this week helped me gain confidence in building React apps, understanding component-based design, and deploying a real project online. It was a great step forward in becoming a better front-end developer.
